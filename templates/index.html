	<p>Foreign owned Multinational Corporations (MNCs) are one of the major contributors to the US economy and job employment. In 2019, the total stocks of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) by the MNCs amounted to $4.46 trillion. Among the foreign investing countries, which ones invest more in the US and why â€“ to address such critical questions, we utilize cutting-edge machine learning modeling technique to build an app. More specifically, our app manipulates a timeseries large dataset since 1982 covering 45 nations and predicts the country specific MNCs-FDI for the most recent year.</p>
