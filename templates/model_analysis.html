			<h6>Data Collection & Data Cleaning:</h6>
			<p>We started with examining a timeseries data on the inward FDI to identify the major countries investing in the US. The available data suggests, in total, there are 45 countries across Europe, Canada & Pacific, Asia, Latin America, and Africa that have been consistently expanding their MNC activities in the US since 1982. The data source of FDI in USA is the Bureau of Economic Analysis (https://www.bea.gov).</p>
			<p>Next, we began our model exploration by inquiring a set of country level variables that are researched to be influential in impacting FDI in USA. In addition to the “Year” and two categorical variables – “Country” and “Region” – we also examined countries’ (i) GDP per Capita, (ii) Stock Market Capitalization, (iii) Globalization Index Scores, (iv) FDI by USA, (v) Government Effectiveness, and (vi) Rule of Law. The data source of these country level variables is the World Bank (https://data.worldbank.org).</p> 
			<p>We performed rigorous data collection and data cleaning steps using the python and pandas to finalize a timeseries dataset of 1710 observations. </p>
